The motivation behind this code is to write a contract that takes a total number shares and distributes them equally after a specified period of time. 

Create Contract DefferedEquityPlan and declare state variables of type uint, address, bool.
The payable employee is active at the start of the contact. Set the total shares and annual distribution values.

The start time will be used for unlocking the contract to be set 365 day after the contract has been deployed. 
Set the variables and message sender using the constructor.  

The Distribute function has a set of requirements that when met unlock after 365 and automatically distrbte the total shares being held in the contract.
The if statement checks if the employee has cashed out after 5+ years if not it keeps the shares at the value we set. 

Deactivate Function require the msg.sender to be authorized.

Revert function reverts any Ether sent to the contract directly.
